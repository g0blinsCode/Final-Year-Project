# Eagle Eye
This project is an intrusion detection system that analyzes network traffic for anomalies using a combination of static rules and artificial intelligence. The system uses a network analyzer written in C++ to capture traffic and then processes it through a set of predefined rules. Any anomalies are then passed on to the AI component for further inspection.

# Features
#### Static rule-based analysis
#### AI-based analysis
#### Network analyzer written in C++
#### Detection of network anomalies
